# missForestFast
`missForestFast` is a project for a case study for improving existing
random-forst-based method [`missForest`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=missForest),
and added the functionalities like outputting intermediate results.

## Accleration of random-forest-based methods
[`missForestFast`](https://github.com/shangzhi-hong/missForestFast)
provides user with the accelerated version of random-forest-based missing data
imputation powered by
[`ranger`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger)
and [`randomForestSRC`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=randomForestSRC)

## Installation for development version from GitHub
Currently the `missForestFast` package is only available as source files on GitHub,
any interested user can install and test the `missForestFast` package by running
the following code in R:

``` r
if(!"remotes" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("shangzhi-hong/missForestFast")
```

Run example:
``` r
library(missForestFast)
data(iris)
set.seed(81)
iris.mis <- prodNA(iris, noNA = 0.2)
impRanger <- missForestRanger(iris.mis, xtrue = iris, keepAll = TRUE)
impSrc <- missForestSrc(iris.mis, xtrue = iris, keepAll = TRUE)
```
