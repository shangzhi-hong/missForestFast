Description: The function 'missForest' in this package is used to
    impute missing values particularly in the case of mixed-type
    data. It uses a random forest trained on the observed values of
    a data matrix to predict the missing values. It can be used to
    impute continuous and/or categorical data including complex
    interactions and non-linear relations. It yields an out-of-bag
    (OOB) imputation error estimate without the need of a test set
    or elaborate cross-validation. It can be run in parallel to 
    save computation time.
